\begin{enumerate}
\item How was your choice of rows and bands motivated? How did you search for the
best parameters? \\ \\
\textbf{Answer}:

\item Conceptually, what would you have to change if you were asked to design an image
  retrieval system that you can query for similar images given a large image
  dataset? \\
